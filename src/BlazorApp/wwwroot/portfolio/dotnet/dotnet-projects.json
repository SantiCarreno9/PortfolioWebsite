    "description": "This web application is built with a .NET Web API connected to a SQLite database, designed to manage and track personal finances efficiently. The API facilitates user registration, and allows users to add, modify, search, filter, and delete transactions. Additionally, it can retrieve specific information such as total values based on categories, locations, payment methods, and transaction types.<br/>On the frontend, Blazor WebAssembly was employed as the framework, offering a responsive and dynamic user experience. The website features a comprehensive dashboard where users can visualize their total expenses, income, and balance over a selected time range. An interactive pie chart provides a summary of transaction totals, which can be broken down by categories, locations, or payment methods.<br/>The transaction management page displays all transactions in a paginated grid, where users can filter, create, modify, or delete transactions. The user-friendly interface for creating transactions supports splitting a transaction into subtransactions, each with its own description, category, and amount. The total transaction amount is automatically calculated by summing all subtransactions.<br/>The entire web application is deployed to Azure, with the Web API and database hosted on Azure App Service and the Blazor WebAssembly frontend deployed to Azure Static Web Apps.",
